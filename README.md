# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

**Oblivio** provides a **user-friendly UI** for running **large language models (LLMs)** locally with **Ollama**.  
It runs on **Docker**, making setup and management super straightforward.

ðŸ§  The **chat interface** is far more convenient than a terminal.  
ðŸ”„ You can easily **switch between different models** with just a few clicks.
